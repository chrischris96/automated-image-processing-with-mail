<p> I have created a web framework with Python. Unfortunately Martin has worked with wordpress (php) so far, which makes it a bit more difficult for us. I will try to redesign the website in the next days to make it work with Python. I probably won't change much about the actual design, because it's pretty clear. </p><br>
